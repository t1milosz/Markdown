### Laptop
A **laptop computer** or **notebook computer**, also known as a **laptop** or **notebook**, 
is a small, portable personal computer (PC). 
Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid 
and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid.
Most of the computer's internal hardware is fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, 
although many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen, and some even feature a touchscreen display. 
In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems, 
which were originally developed for desktop computers.

The word laptop, modeled after the term desktop (as in desktop computer), refers to the fact that the computer can be practically placed on the user's lap;
while the word notebook refers to most laptops sharing a form factor with paper notebooks. As of 2024, in American English, 
the terms laptop and notebook are used interchangeably; in other dialects of English, one or the other may be preferred. 
The term notebook originally referred to a type of __portable computer__ that was smaller and lighter than mainstream laptops of the time, 
but has since come to mean the same thing and no longer refers to any specific size.

### Types of laptops

Since the 1970s introduction of portable computers, their forms have changed significantly, 
__spawning__ a variety of visually and technologically differing subclasses. 
Excepting distinct legal trademark around terms (notably __Ultrabook__), hard distinctions between these classes were rare, 
and their usage has varied over time and between sources. Since the late 2010s, more specific terms have become less commonly used, 
with sizes distinguished largely by the size of the screen.

### Smaller and larger laptops

Main articles: Notebook (laptop), Subnotebook, and Desktop replacement computer
There were in the past a number of marketing categories for smaller and larger laptop computers; 
these included "__notebook__" and "__subnotebook__" models, low cost "__netbooks__", 
and "__ultra-mobile PCs__" where the size class overlapped with devices like __smartphone__ and handheld __tablets__, 
and "__Desktop replacement__" laptops for machines notably larger and heavier than typical to operate more powerful __processors__ or __graphics hardware__.
All of these terms have fallen out of favor as the size of mainstream laptops has gone down and their capabilities have gone up; 
except for niche models, laptop sizes tend to be distinguished by the size of the screen, and for more powerful models, 
by any specialized purpose the machine is intended for, such as a "__gaming laptop__" or a "__mobile workstation__" for professional use.

### Rugged laptop

A rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations, 
extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, 
and much more expensive than regular laptops, and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.

### Hardware

The basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. 
Traditionally they were __miniaturized__ and adapted to mobile use, The design restrictions on power, size, 
and __cooling__ of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, 
although that difference has increasingly narrowed.

In general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable by the end-user, 
except for components that can be detached; in the past, batteries and optical drives were commonly exchangeable. 
Some laptops feature socketed processors with sockets such as the __Socket G2__, 
but many laptops use processors that are soldered to the motherboard. 
Many laptops come with RAM and storage that is soldered to the motherboard and cannot be easily replaced. 
This restriction is one of the major differences between laptops and desktop computers, 
because the large "__tower__" cases used in desktop computers are designed so that new __motherboards__, __hard disks__, 
__sound cards__, __RAM__, and other components can be added. Memory and storage can often be upgraded with some disassembly, 
but with the most compact laptops, there may be no upgradeable components at all.
